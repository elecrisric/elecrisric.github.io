You should consider the level of detail that will be needed for your design and how your space will look.</li><li>Use the right colors – Cool wallpaper can be paired with any color scheme or pattern. If you want a more unique look, Experiment with different colors and patterns.</li><li>Use cutouts or borders – Cutouts let you create a personalized look without having to buy anything extra.
